# Vulnerability Assessment Using Nessus

## Abstract
In this project, Nessus was used to perform vulnerability assessments on three virtual machines (VMs) from a Kali VM. The scans aimed to identify critical vulnerabilities and provide remediation suggestions. The results were captured and analyzed to understand the security posture of the VMs.

## Introduction
This report details the process of using Nessus for vulnerability assessment. The objective was to identify vulnerabilities on three VMs using Nessus and capture the results for analysis. We will be analysing one vulnerability from each VM and Identifying it's correlating CVE, along with an explanation of the vulnerability.

## IP Addresses:
- Kali: 192.168.48.129
- Metasploitable Linux: 192.168.48.130
- Metasploitable Win2k8: 192.168.48.132
- Windows XP: 192.168.48.131

## Kali VM
The Kali VM was used as the primary tool for conducting the scans. It provided the necessary environment and tools for vulnerability scanning and analysis.

## Scan Reports
## Metasploitable Linux:

The initial scan on Metasploitable Linux reveals several vulnerabilities, highlighting the need for further analysis.
